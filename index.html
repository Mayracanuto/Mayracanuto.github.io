     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>I consider myself as a passionate for what I do, sociable highly creative and committed. Something that distinguishes
       me is the customer service and flexibility to work with people from different cultures and nationalities.</p>
     <p>I am a graduated student from the Communication and digital media program at the Tecnologico de Monterrey in Queretaro,
       Mexico.</p>
     <p>During my last year as univerity student I started working at GE Aviation as Internal Communications designer.
       Once I finished with this internship, I decided to have an international work experience, so I started to work
       as Aupair in Germany. This new job helped me to improve my German language skills and also gave me the opening
       to travel around the world.</p>
